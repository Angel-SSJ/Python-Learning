Important Points
    python docstrings are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module.
    Python commments vs Docstring
        Comments are description that help programmers better understand the intent and funcionality of the program
        we use # to write a single-line comment.
        The comments are ignored by the Python interpreter

        Python docstrings are string used right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module.
        We can access these docstring using __doc__ attribute.

    Single-line docstring in Python
        Conventions
            Even though they are single-lined, we still use the triple quotes around these docstrings as they can be expanded easily later.
            The closing quotes are on the same line as the opening quotes.
            There's no blank line either before or after the docstring.
            They should not be descriptive, rather they must follow "Do this, return that" structure ending with a period.

    Multi-line Docstrings in Python
        Python modules
            The docstrings for Python Modules should list all the available classes, functions, objects and exceptions that are imported when the module is imported.
            They should also have a one-line summary for each item.
        Python Functions
            The docstring for a function or method should summarize its behavior and document its arguments and return values.
            It should also list all the exceptions that can be raised and other optional arguments.
        Python Classes
            The docstring for a class should summarize its behavior and document its attributes and methods.
            It should also list all the exceptions that can be raised and other optional arguments.


    Styles Docstring
        Sphinx Style: Often used in large projects where comprehensive documentation is required. It integrates well with Sphinx's documentation generator.
        Google Style: Ideal for projects where simplicity and readability are prioritized, especially within organizations using Google's style guides.
        NumPy Style: Best suited for projects requiring detailed and extensive documentation, common in data science and scientific computing.
        PyDoc: Useful for generating text and HTML documentation, but lacks the structured format of others.


    As you learned that docstrings are accessible through the built-in Python __doc__ attribute and the help() function.
